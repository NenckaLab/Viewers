# JSONMeasurementImporter Refactoring

This directory contains a refactored version of the large `JSONMeasurementImporter.tsx` file (2424 lines) broken down into smaller, more manageable modules.

## File Structure

### Main File
- `JSONMeasurementImporterRefactored.tsx` - The main orchestrator file that imports and uses the smaller modules

### Utility Functions (`utils/`)
- `measurementSourceUtils.ts` - Functions for getting measurement sources
- `imageIdUtils.ts` - Functions for resolving image IDs and display set information
- `splineUtils.ts` - Spline interpolation utilities
- `identityMapping.ts` - Identity mapping function for data transformation

### Protection System (`protection/`)
- `removalProtection.ts` - System for protecting recently imported measurements from premature removal

### Tool Handlers (`handlers/`)
- `lengthToolHandler.ts` - Logic specific to Length tool processing
- `roiToolHandler.ts` - Logic for RectangleROI, EllipticalROI, and CircleROI tools

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each file has a single responsibility and is easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Individual modules can be unit tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Utility functions can be reused across different parts of the codebase
4. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to navigate and understand
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Modules (Current)
- ✅ Extract utility functions
- ✅ Extract protection system
- ✅ Extract tool handlers for Length and ROI tools
- ⏳ Create remaining tool handlers (Bidirectional, ArrowAnnotate, Freehand tools)
- ⏳ Extract viewport management logic
- ⏳ Extract measurement processing logic

### Phase 2: Complete Refactoring
- ⏳ Create remaining handlers for all tool types
- ⏳ Extract viewport refresh and annotation visibility logic
- ⏳ Extract measurement processing and display text logic
- ⏳ Update imports in the main file

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- ⏳ Test the refactored version against the original
- ⏳ Ensure all functionality is preserved
- ⏳ Update any dependent files to use the new structure

## Usage

To use the refactored version:

```typescript
import { importMeasurementCollection } from './JSONMeasurementImporterRefactored';

// Use the same API as the original
const result = await importMeasurementCollection({
  collectionJSON,
  servicesManager,
});
```

## TODO Items

### Tool Handlers to Create
- [ ] `bidirectionalToolHandler.ts` - Bidirectional tool logic
- [ ] `arrowAnnotateHandler.ts` - ArrowAnnotate tool logic  
- [ ] `freehandToolHandler.ts` - PlanarFreehandROI, SplineROI, LivewireContour logic

### Additional Modules to Create
- [ ] `viewport/` - Viewport management and refresh logic
- [ ] `processing/` - Core measurement processing logic
- [ ] `displayText/` - Display text generation logic

### Current Status
The refactoring is in progress. The main file has been reduced from 2424 lines to approximately 800 lines, with utility functions and some tool handlers extracted. The remaining complex logic (viewport management, annotation visibility, etc.) still needs to be extracted into separate modules.

## Notes

- The original `JSONMeasurementImporter.tsx` file should be kept until the refactoring is complete and tested
- All imports use relative paths to maintain the current structure
- The refactored version maintains the same public API as the original
